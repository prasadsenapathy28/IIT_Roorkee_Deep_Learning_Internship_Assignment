# EEG Deep Learning Analysis

This project focuses on the analysis of EEG data to classify different cognitive states using advanced deep learning techniques. The data is sourced from the Mental Arithmetic Tasks Dataset available at PhysioNet.

## Overview

The tasks involved in this project include:
1. Loading EEG data
2. Performing Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis
3. Implementing and evaluating deep learning models for binary classification

## Dataset

The dataset is the Mental Arithmetic Tasks Dataset from PhysioNet.
